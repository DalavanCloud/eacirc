To run the application, set the config.xml file and run the binary without any parameter.
If you want to start with partly evolved circuit, put the circuit in .bin format into the executable folder.
To disable evolution, run the binary with "-evolutionoff" parameter.
To test the static circuit, run the binary with "-staticcircuit" parameter (in this case, you will need pre-generated test vectors as binary files and pre-compiled evolved circuit).
